# tic-tac-toe (front-end)

For a potential new job, they asked me to make a simple tic-tac-toe game using
Emberjs in the frontend and Ruby on Rails in the backend. Both frameworks which
I'm not familiar with. Pretty exciting and a good learning oppertunity!

The repository for the backend can be found here: 
[Ruby on Rails (tic-tac-toe backend)](https://github.com/Thewessen/tic-tac-toe_ruby_backend)

If you want to know more about the learning process of creating this app, I'm
happy to refer too the [wiki-page](https://github.com/Thewessen/tic-tac-toe_ruby_backend/wiki)
